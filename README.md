# Machine Failure Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for forecasting machine failures using historical data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model will help in proactive maintenance, reducing downtime, and improving operational efficiency.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for machine learning.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful features that improve the predictive power of the model.
- **Model Training**: Train various machine learning models and select the best performing one.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics and validate its performance.
- **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict machine failures on new data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-failure-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd machine-failure-prediction
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Run the data preprocessing script to clean and preprocess the data.
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Generate features from the processed data.
   ```bash
   python feature_engineering.py
   ```

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train the machine learning models.
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained model.
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

5. **Prediction**:
   - Use the model to predict machine failures.
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```
